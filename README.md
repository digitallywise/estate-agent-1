LUXVILLAS

Luxvillas is an Estate agent that promotes luxury villas for rent for its clients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia through creation of dedicated websites that are optimised for search engine.

The target audiences are foreign nationals such as investors who do business in the country, diplomats working in embassies and the African Union which has its headquarter in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  These particular audiences require a reliable information in English as well as a property that meets their family needs including safety, security and uninterrupted water and electric supply. This website exactly provides that by presenting handpicked property that suites their family needs, in a language they understand. 
Features

Sticky responsive navigation bar
The sticky responsive navigation bar provides all anchor links to each section of the page including to the description of the property, specification, location information, a form to book a viewing appointment and to the footer section. What makes this navigation bar useful is that it sticks to the top of the page as the user scrolls up making it easy to navigate to other sections or go back to the top. This is identical every time the user jumps to different section. On a mobile version it changes to a toggle navbar button and a home button and expands only when the user clicks on the toggle button. Once the user clicks on a link it will hide the list but remains at the top of the page.

The small banner across the top
This banner contains the logo as well us the monthly rental price of the property. I believe the rental price will save time for the wrong audiences as well as portraying honesty and transparency to the right audiences.  People want to have an idea of the rental cost and don’t want to waste their valuable time browsing, if the property is above their budget. 

Looping picture slider/Carousel
The looping picture slider contains multiple images of the property and displays sequentially while still allowing users to take control through the carousel control “next and previous” button to flick through the property pictures without opening a popup window.

The landing page 
The landing page contains the header which explains what this website is all about as well as the type of villa and its location.
the small banner contains the Luxvillas’ logo as well as the monthly rental price for the property. 
The carousel/picture slider sequentially displays large images fitting the screen horizontally to grab the user’s attention. 

Description Section
This is the most important part of the website which describes the type of property Luxvillas are promoting through the use of languages that would trigger emotional response. These includes the security feature which often concerns foreigners as well as reassuring them about electric supply which often gets cut off and affects everyone in the country. The content is also written with SEO in mind and is used in the header, title and meta tag keywords. 
Specification section
The Specification section of the website is  uses icons to represent each feature of the property as well as describing each feature including the bedrooms, living room and jacuzzi giving them the full picture of the property.



Location section
The location section gives the potential tenant/user local amenities such as  transport services, shopping malls, schools, cinemas and parks to help them make a decision. 


Form to allow users to book a viewing appointment
Each of the above sections are laid out in a way that would lead them to this section to create an enquiry and finally to rent the property. The form allows a user to enter their details and select a suitable date and time to book a viewing appointment. The form is using formspree API to submit the enquiry.

Footer section
The footer section contains the general contact details such as address and P.O. Box number.

Resources used to complete this project

Responsive navigation bar
The responsive navigation bar was created using W3c and further modified. 

Original navigation bar from W3c used a:active background class applied to home page and I modified that to make sure the usability is not compromised. As can be seen in the image below the active link background is applied to whatever link the user clicks on.

Picture slider 
The picture slider/carousel was taken from Bootstrap and modified with contents.

Responsive Appointment booking form 
This was created using W3c tutorial and further modified including adding the reset button, repositioning items, adjusting the padding and margins and changing colours to fit with the brand colour.

The website was continuously tested to make sure HML and CSS are valid as well as making sure the website is accessible.
